## Did I create a new markdown file?
- When I look up how to do things, it looks very different from what I see when I am logged into github.
- I worry that the instructions are not as updated as the most recent version of github.
- The markdown formatting looked very similar to Python, so I'm trying things that normally work in Python and hoping for the best.
